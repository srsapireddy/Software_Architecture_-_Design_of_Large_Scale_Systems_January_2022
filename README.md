# Cloud Based Load Balancing Solutions
8. AWS - Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
a. Application (Layer 7) Load Balancer - Ideal for advanced load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic
b. Network (Layer 4) Load Balancer - Ideal for load balancing of both TCP and UDP traffic
c. Gateway Load Balancer - Ideal for deploying, scaling, and managing your third-party virtual appliances.
d. Classic Load Balancer (Layer 4 and 7) - Ideal for routing traffic to EC2 instances.

9. GCP - Cloud Load Balancing</br>
a. External HTTP(S) Load Balancer - Externally facing HTTP(s) (Layer 7) load balancer which enables you to run and scale your services behind an internal IP address.</br>
b. Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancer - Internal Layer 7 load balancer that enables you to run and scale your services behind an internal IP address.</br>
c. External TCP/UDP Network Load Balancer - Externally facing TCP/UDP (Layer 4) load balancer</br>
d. Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancer - Internally facing TCP/UDP (Layer 4) load balancer</br>

10. Microsoft Azure Load Balancer</br>
a. Standard Load Balancer - Public and internal Layer 4 load balancer</br>
b. Gateway Load Balancer - High performance and high availability load balancer for third-party Network Virtual Appliances.</br>
c. Basic Load Balancer - Ideal for small scale application</br>

11. GSLB Solutions</br>
a. Amazon Route 53 - Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service.</br>
b. Google Cloud Platform Load Balancer & Cloud DNS - Reliable, resilient, low-latency DNS serving from Google's worldwide network with everything you need to register, manage, and serve your domains.</br>
c. Azure Traffic Manager - DNS-based load balancing</br>
